# Thorin & Co 
## A web app built with Python and Flask

Thorin & Company is a page to display information about Thorin Oakenshield and his company of dwarves, from The Hobbit.

The site is built to demonstrate using Python and Flask to consume JSON data and generate HTML content.  The live page is deployed on Heroku.  

The styling and layout were obtained from the [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog) template from Start Bootstrap, and the Python/Flask code tutorial was provided by the Code Institute Full-Stack Software Development course.
